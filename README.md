MinifyHtml
==========

CakePHP 5, HTML Minify Plugin

### Installation ###

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `~`.

First, add this in your composer.json
```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "github",
        "url":  "git@github.com:niti-netro42/MinifyHtml.git"
    }
]
```

Then you can run this following composer command
```
composer require netro42/minify-html
```

## Bootstrap ##

Plugins are loaded in your applicationâ€™s `bootstrap()` function:

```php
// In src/Application.php
use Cake\Http\BaseApplication;
use Netro42\MinifyHtml\Plugin as MinifyHtmlPlugin;

class Application extends BaseApplication {
    public function bootstrap()
    {
        parent::bootstrap();

        // Load the minify html plugin by class name
        $this->addPlugin(MinifyHtmlPlugin::class);
    }
}
```

### Usage ###

After loading this plugin in your `bootstrap.php` the helper can be enabled in the `AppView` by loading the `Netro42/MinifyHtml.MinifyHtml` helper like the example below:

```php
class AppView extends View
{
    public function initialize(): void
    {
        $this->loadHelper('Netro42/MinifyHtml.MinifyHtml');
    }
}
```

#### Note on debug ####

When debug mode is on nothing will be minified.

### Usage in other plugins ###

##### [dereuromark/cakephp-cache](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-cache) #####

To use MinifyHtml instead of `dereuromark/cakephp-cache`'s own HTML minifier. Set the [`compress` configuration option](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-cache#component-configuration) to:
```php
'\Netro42\MinifyHtml\compress'
```

### Configuration ###

All configuration is namespaced, just as this plugin into `Netro42.MinifyHtml`. The following options are available:

`debugOverride` (bool) Defaults to `false`. Everwrite debug and minify when debug it on. 
`factory` (string) Defaults to `WyriHaximus\HtmlCompress\Factory::constructFastest`. Speficy a parser factory, `constructFastest`, `construct`, and `constructSmallest` are build in.
